        "description": "üìù The Transformers BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer) Model is a state-of-the-art text summarization model that aims to understand the entire document and generate paraphrased text to summarize the main points. BART uses a standard Seq2Seq bidirectional encoder (like BERT) and a left-to-right autoregressive decoder (like GPT) to combine the best of both worlds. It has been shown to achieve high accuracy and fluency in summarizing a variety of texts, including news articles, scientific papers, and legal documents. BART is a powerful tool for information retrieval and can save time and effort by quickly summarizing long texts. Some of its features include:\n\n* A bidirectional encoder that reads the entire document\n* A left-to-right autoregressive decoder that generates the summary\n* Paraphrasing capabilities that allow it to rephrase the text"
