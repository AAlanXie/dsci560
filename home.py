    ## Project Description:
    This project aims to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process and analyze social media data from sources such as Twitter, Reddit, and government websites within the Los Angeles area to understand the public's perception and sentiment towards key city services such as transportation, waste management, and public safety. The goal is to provide city officials with a comprehensive understanding of the public's views on these services and inform decision-making efforts to enhance them, resulting in increased customer satisfaction, reduced costs, and improved reputation for the city.
